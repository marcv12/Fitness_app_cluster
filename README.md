# Fitness App User Clustering Project

## Description
In this project, I cluster customers of a fitness app according to their activity levels using machine learning tools. The primary aim is to develop targeted marketing campaigns to motivate and retain users based on their behavior patterns. I adopted the six-step process of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate earned on Coursera for this project.

## Installation
Ensure you have a Python environment with relevant ML libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn installed. 

## Project Motivation
To understand the users' engagement with the fitness app and improve user retention by delivering personalized marketing campaigns. The challenge was to group users into distinct clusters based on their engagement patterns: frequency, intensity, and variety of workout programs.

## File Description
The `fitness_app` folder contains three primary files:
- `main.py`: The Python script for executing the entire workflow of the project.
- `intensityVSdiversity.csv`: A cleaned and aggregated dataset with unique user IDs and their workout details.
- `data_with_clusters.csv`: Final output file showing each user's assigned cluster.

The `CASE PRESENTATION.pptx` file provides an extensive explanation of the project steps and findings.

## How To Interact With This Project
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `fitness_app` folder.
2. The Python script `main.py` contains the entire project's code, including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, clustering, and results visualization.
3. Run the `main.py` script and explore the output CSV files to understand the user clustering results.

You can also view the `CASE PRESENTATION.pptx` to get an in-depth understanding of the project steps and decisions.

## Acknowledgements
The project leverages Machine Learning and SQL querying to efficiently group users into three categories: Less Active (Green), Diversified (Red), and Intense (Black). Each group receives a tailored marketing campaign for enhanced user engagement. The SQL queries used to extract data for each cluster are included in the `main.py` script.

Remember to explore both the Python script and the presentation to fully understand the project. Enjoy exploring the intriguing world of user behavior analysis and targeted marketing!
